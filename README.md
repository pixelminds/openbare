# OpenBare
**OpenBare** is an open starter theme with a minimal approach, and versioned to 5 formats: plain static HTML, plus the 3 main CMS.
Each version is built on top of the official barebones starter kit:
1. For **HTML** we used [HTML5Boilerplate v. 6.0.1](https://html5boilerplate.com/).
2. For **WordPress** we used [Underscores](https://underscores.me/).
3. For **Drupal 7** we used [Stark](https://www.drupal.org/project/stark).
4. For **Drupal 8** we used the same theme, in its D8 version.
5. For **Prestashop** we used the official [StarterTheme](https://github.com/PrestaShop/StarterTheme).

This project started with the need to rapidly build a theme in response to our clients' demands. The fact of using different frameworks depending on the CMS platform, or when opting for plain HTML, has always driven to frustration. I believe we can work on a general method, and try to build a concept from there, which is translatable into any structure.

We're just taking off, so please be patient. We hope we cab get to a release candidate sometime before summer.
